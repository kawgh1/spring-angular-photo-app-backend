### Springboot Angular Photo Sharing Web App - Backend

This project was based on a course by "Get Arrays - Software Development Teaching Platform"
https://www.udemy.com/course/building-a-restful-api-application-using-spring-and-angular/

This was a great project. I did not add much, but it did require quite a bit of troubleshooting.
I did add some mobile formatting, UX improvements and some code fixes.

#### Things I learned about:

- Spring Security
- Java Mail API for sending pre-formed automated e-mails based on a user action (ex. new user registration)
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication and Authorization with Java, SpringBoot + Angular
- HttpInterceptors
- Web Caching
- Google Maps API
- Angular Resolvers (https://codeburst.io/understanding-resolvers-in-angular-736e9db71267)

#### Notes

This project is a photo sharing application and stores the user uploaded photos directly on the main Backend Server. 
In a real-world environment this is not ideal and would cause major slow down with user growth. The Server set up
is strictly for learning and demonstration purposes.
